I'm creating a new file and commiting it.



Here i'm trying to create and new branch and try to merge it later.



I'm writing this line after successfully merging it.
I first created a branch and after that when i went back to code space and there i could see that a new branch has been created and it's asking me to create a pull
request and merge the branch.
after that it is checking if the file is comaparable and it's asking to commit and confirm the merge.
After I confirm it ,and redirected back to code,and when the opened experiment I could see the merge sentence at line no.5



OK,So from what i have seen, if  want to contribute to someone else's project all I have to do is just fork their project(as i cannot edit directly) and create new file and make a pull request.This request goes to the owner of the project and that is how they can review and merge.


ANd also the person who sends a pull request in their repository can see the file they have created along with the other files they have forked from the project they wanted to contribute to.


Now once your pull request has been merged in the project you wanted to contribute to,then whenever someone opens the project you contributed to in that your name will be visible on the file that has been merged.(the file for which you have created a pull request)
