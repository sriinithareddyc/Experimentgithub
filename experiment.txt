I'm creating a new file and commiting it.



Here i'm trying to create and new branch and try to merge it later.



I'm writing this line after successfully merging it.
I first created a branch and after that when i went back to code space and there i could see that a new branch has been created and it's asking me to create a pull
request and merge the branch.
after that it is checking if the file is comaparable and it's asking to commit and confirm the merge.
After I confirm it ,and redirected back to code,and when the opened experiment I could see the merge sentence at line no.5



OK,So from what i have seen, if  want to contribute to someone else's project all I have to do is just fork their project(as i cannot edit directly) and create new file and make a pull request.This request goes to the owner of the project and that is how they can review and merge.


ANd also the person who sends a pull request in their repository can see the file they have created along with the other files they have forked from the project they wanted to contribute to.
